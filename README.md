# Requirements

* IDE(Intellij, VS, Eclipse)

# Usage
```
Working to add a command run line
```
Currently have to run the program in IDE with all three code being in the same folder. Current version has `Vertical Seam Carving` feature in future updates and commits will work on to add `Horizontal Seam Carving`, ` Object Removal` & `Seam Insertion`. The main objective of this project I'm working on is to provide a website with features : `Resizing` `Object Removal` using the above given features.

#### Current procedure to run ####
Insert your required image to the file with .java files --> In the `main.java` give the path to file `./your.img` --> Mention the required width in console --> Your required .img file will be output as Seamcarved.img in the directory.
